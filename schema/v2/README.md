# V2 catalog contract

V2 separates stable model semantics from everything that changes with runtime
or implementation:

1. `model-ir.v2` owns semantic nodes, symbolic shapes, and data-flow edges.
2. `execution-plan.v2` derives a topology-specific graph with explicit
   sharding, placement, and collectives.
3. `implementation-binding.v2` attaches commit-specific source symbols and
   kernel signatures to existing execution nodes.
4. `profile.v2` attaches measured values to existing execution nodes.

Bindings may declare `extends: <implementation_id>` when the source commit is
the same but an execution plan changes topology-specific nodes. The compiler
reuses only inherited bindings whose node IDs exist in the derived execution
graph, then applies the derived file's node overrides. This keeps source
identity versioned without duplicating the common model-to-code mapping for
every parallelism path.

Profiles and bindings may never create or mutate semantic model nodes. A new
execution graph is created only when an execution plan changes the structural
fingerprint (operator flow, sharding, placement, or collectives).

The JSON Schema files document the persisted contract. The compiler also runs
cross-document checks that JSON Schema cannot express, including node-reference
integrity, execution-path compatibility, topology constraints, and deterministic
fingerprinting.
